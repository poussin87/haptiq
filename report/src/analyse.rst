Analyse
=======

The following chapter presents a state of the art focused on the technologies that could enable exploration of graphs without sight. On a second part it will try to synthesise some knowledge gathered on the way mathematical concepts are taught or shared.
Making an exhaustive taxonomy would be illusionnary as research related to haptics devices has been diversified since ?? (01__). Yet, this chapter will present the different solutions available for blind people in order to explore maps, graphs or data.

This background research is based on the doctoral thesis of Thomas_Pietrzak__ on "Dissemination of haptics information in a multimodal environnement" and on the master thesis of Simone__ on "The HaptiQ: A Haptic Device for Graph Exploration by People with Visual Disabilities".

State of the art
----------------


.. ref needed
Braille
+++++++

The braille is a tactile writing system that has been spreaded over the world since since 1824. Although it could potentially represents some form of graphs with series of dots, arrows, bullets it is intended for reading text. The main issue remains the fact that it is difficult to learn and thinking that all blind people would know it is a common misinformation.

ScreenReaders 
+++++++++++++

VIP rely heavily on their audio sens in order to compensate their handicap. This heavy usage would even trigger an "obstacle perception" [95]. ScreenReaders provides an efficient alternative to access text. Several screen readers alternatives are available [#]_.
If only a few would enable navigation tasks as well like JAWS or VoiceOver from Apple, the main issue remains the usage of audio as a channel for spatial guidance. VIP are not necessarily inclined to use cardinal points neither up, down, right and left as a way of orientation and map exploration through a Screen Reader would require a constant audio feedback. These aspects disqualify this medium as the most suited.
Besides, it is preferable to interfer with the audio channel as little as possible in order to facilitate the debit of textual information expressed this way.

Tactile Maps
++++++++++++

Tactile maps are paper heated to form bumps and relief in order to create shapes. They are popular among visually impaired people as way to learn geometry or explore a map. Even though they offer lots of tactile freedom - it is easier to grasp a general idea of the shapes by using the ten fingers, they do not provide further interaction unless they are combined with a tabletop such as the Multimodal Interactive Maps (MIMs) project [6]. MIMs is an input / output system mixing different technolgies. They keep to property of ten fingers exploration, but require a new printing for each visualisation.
The main issue of tactile maps remains the fact that the scanning and printing process would require the help of another person and thus, do not contribute in the autonomity of VIP.

Air
+++

Feedbacks can be perceived via air motion. It triggers the same signals than with tactile thanks to the variety of sensitivy receptors [88, 101]. AIREAL [19] makes this approach possible and uses a motion detector camera as their input. Using highly pressured air wave allows long distance interaction (10m); it is besides scalable and affordable. Even though they offer wide range of angle from which the air is pushed, it lakes of resolution. Its usage is more suited for gaming experience than for the visually impaired.

(figure Homonculus sensoriel ?)

If we were to represent the human body by its touch sensitivy, we would end up with a weak figurine if enormous hands, lips and tongue.
This is maybe why bolder interaction are exploiting the latter with the Tongue Display Unit [9]. This display places a seven by seven grid filled with electrodes on the tongue and could be used in scenarios when both of the hands are taken: as for instance a working surgeon.

Although intriguing both of these displays allow limited interaction and are suited for very perticular scenarios.

Conclusion
----------

Many alternatives exist, yet the issue remains that we are too focus on the way to represent data more than giving the underlying meaning of them. It might be more relevant to focus on the general trends more than the exact measurment. Let us remember that it is really hard to learn for VIP, the simple knowledge of a squared angle is not easily acquired.
(ref: 01__)

The following list states the properties to be taken into account. It is a result of these background researchs and gives the direction towards what we want to go.

Also, most of these devices offers a one time solution. What should be important is to see if we can facilitate the interaction, then allow applications to easily build on top of those interaction
