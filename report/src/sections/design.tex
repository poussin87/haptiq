\chapter{Design}

Tactile vector based devices are inexplored in haptics research, our aim
is to provide some feedback on their usage for graph exploration. Yet,
the key points are to design a device that is affordable and easily
reproducible. Our design path also expects to reach the open-source
community in order to ease further contributions. In this chapter, I
will present the device and its functionalities and discuss the
different choices that have been made in order to build a functional
prototype for our research.

\section{Global design}\label{global-design}

The HaptiQ can be seen as a movable device with tactons to aid graph
exploration. These tactile feedback are given by actuators on the top of
the device forming a star shape. They are directly linked to the hands.
Moving the device is an input data provided by the user, just as if we
were to move a mouse. This motion is then tracked and processed by a
software layer that will trigger a certain tactile signal, called
tacton. The device will lif the actuators up and down according to this
tacton signal.

This is how the HaptiQ itself works and the software must meet its
requirements. We can also go beyond these first requirements and provide
a standard API for interaction to be integrated into the software
allowing one interaction to be loaded from a list. Such a software
Although this is the main workflow for the HaptiQ, we do want to be able
to compare this interaction to other techniques. This is why special
efforts have been made for the software part that I will detail.

The feelings that the users experienced by using this device -- the
tactons -- have a direct impact on the usability of the whole system.
Human Computer Interactions (HCI) skills have been applied in order to
make sure that the final tactons are suited for the task of graph
exploration.

Although important, these tactons are supported and limited by the
hardware. It has required various skills in order to build the case,
assemble the electronic components and set up every actuator.

first agen taking care of tracking, the software, a tacton

\section{Design of the hardware}\label{design-of-the-hardware}

The HaptiQ receives the tacton signal to execute. The tactile sensation
is coming from a rubbery cap that is being vertically moved by a
servomotor controlled by an Arduino electronic card. These components
are placed inside a 3D printed case. This chapter will detail each part
of this hardware.

\subsection{Actuator element}\label{actuator-element}

An actuator element is made of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  a cap with a rubbery feeling
\item
  a vertical plastic stick that supports the cap
\item
  a servormotor that transmits a vertical motion to the plastic stick
\item
  a 3D printed servo-holder which offers an appropriate casing for the
  servomotor
\end{itemize}

All these elements were brought up by the collaboration of Conte Simone
and Hoggan Eve. who have previously worked on a first version of the
HaptiQ. The cap is made from a special material that can be used by a 3D
printer and this gives a soft, yet elastic feeling. The shape can be
described as a segment with a height on a top of a triangle. The
vertical plastic stick enables to move this cap above the servomotor and
is fixed to it by a small rubber. The vertical servomotor are one of the
best ratio of small and inexpensive - they cost each \euro{12} and are
about 2cm in height. The servo-holder is a design made by Eve.

The actuators were hold but not nicely maintened which would lead to
some pressure to the wires and an uneven tactile sensation on the hands.
From my point of view, solutions for hardware problems need to be
revertible as I were dealing with specific servomotors and 3D printed
objects that can take a lot of time to reprint. I have first tried a
very basic solution of using bluetack as a way of soft maintener which
did offer a short run solution. It was still too untight to be
practical. So I have drilled the servo-holder in order to make a even
height position for all the servomotors and leaving some space for the
wires to go through. An elastic rubber band was then placed to avoid
jiggling movements from them.

In order to be sure the servo holder stick well onto the first layer of
the case my best option was scratch. It does not damage the objects, it
is not messy like the glue and it allows adjusting the servo-holder
under a minute.

(figure of a drilled servo holder)

In order to work, the servomotor needs to be powered and controlled by
an electronic board.

\subsection{Electronic components}\label{electronic-components}

Arduino is an electronic card that is backed by a huge opensource
community. This makes the workflow of running programs on it fairly easy
and highly documented. Because of its flexibility, many other electronic
firms have built shield or extension components to enhance the
possibilities or the card. This is the case of the Adafruit card that we
are using on top of a Arduino Uno. This extra shield allows to easily
map the circuits of the servomotors to the Arduino card which enables
their control in the programme.

In order to make the device nomad, two batteries are needed one for the
Arduino, one for the Adafruit. Yet, the commands could not be received,
which has led us to add a bluetooth component and turn the HaptiQ into a
fully wireless device.

\subsection{Case}\label{case}

The case is also a design provided by Eve H as she has preivously worked
on another version of the HaptiQ. Having it this massive did lead to
some concerns, but it is actually more impressive than a problem.
Ideally,

Besides, even though 3D printing is widely spread - the actual process
of going from zero knowledge to the printing of such pieces can be and
was time costly. For instance a poorly configured printer took about 30
hours to print all the mention parts for this device.

Although a new promising design was delivered by Eve, the timing was too
short for a risk free transfer.

\section{Design of the software}\label{design-of-the-software}

The software is the agent that enables interactions for graph
exploration. It has been made flexible enough to change the used set of
tactons on demand. The architecture has also been designed in order to
facilitate a change of interaction technique, again on demand.

We need a way to evaluate the HaptiQ in order to understand its assets
and failures in a task of exploration. One way to achieve this is by
comparing several interaction techniques for the exact same set up. This
puts a requirement on the software to be able to change interaction
easily keeping the exact same set-up.

The final and current state of the software has been achieved by an
iterative exploratory approach and many refactoring. This has led to
three main threads (Input listener, Graphic User Interface or GUI,
Interaction executer) communicating through four main components
(Network, Interaction, Device).

\subsection{Graph component}\label{graph-component}

This component is used as the container of all the geometric logic that
are involved in graph exploration. More precisely, it contains the
collection of Nodes and Links that respectively inherit the functions
for Points and Lines. These collections can be processed by the GUI and
appear on the screen. An existing libraries that provides functions for
graphs and network manipulation was considered \footnote{\url{https://networkx.github.io/}}.
Our needs were too perticular in order to use such an extern ressource
easily and on the same time, the computation complexity for our need
remained sufficiently low to be easily done during this internship.

(figure showing up a graph)

\subsection{Interaction component}\label{interaction-component}

A graph exploration requires two things, what is explored - the network,
and how -the interaction. This component has came late in the
development process as the first objective was to make the HaptiQ work
and then enable multiple interaction techniques: which requires more
thinking and a better outlook. The interaction component makes sure that
all the derives interactions follows these three basics functionalities:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  open: which will verify if the system meets the requirements for this
  interaction and therefore avoid any error
\item
  process: is called by the interaction thread every loop turn; it
  computes the appropriate output from a given situation and executes it
\item
  closed: which would close the remaining process linked to this
  interction opened during its usage
\end{itemize}

By such a structure, it was easy to adapt the HaptiQ interaction
previously made and at the same time offering a standard way of creating
an interaction technique. Besides, it offers a control over the
execution time which is necessary for our user study.

During open, this component makes sure that a network is available. For
more specific interaction like the HaptiQ, it checks the availability of
the device component. This is how the input is made available during
process for computation.

Building this interface has turned a first restricted version of the
software into an evolutive program that can now accept various
interaction techniques. Future collaboration has been made available by
this refactoring.

\subsection{Device component}\label{device-component}

The device component is a virtual representation of the HaptiQ. It has
therefore a position, an orientation and the state of each of the
actuators. Each actuator is characterized by an angle or a direction -
like North which would be equivalent to 90Â°, that is fixed and a level -
between 0 and 100, that can be changed.

As it is a representation of the device, all the interaction techniques
that are dealing with the HaptiQ are using this component as the
reference for the position. More than a representation of the current
state, it is actually the state in which the HaptiQ should be. Attribute
like the position are directly depending on the user and can only be
updated, but it is a security regarding the levels of the actuators. It
happens that the HaptiQ does not execute the latest tactons and gets
stucked in an other state which does not match the real situation. Using
this device component as the reference for the level of each actuator
makes the system less prone to context errors.

\subsection{Input tracker}\label{input-tracker}

This is the thread that is constantly listening to the information
regarding the HaptiQ. These information are shared by the TUIO protocol.
It simply means that the information is formatted in certain rules which
makes the parsing process easier. The tracker receives a variety of data
in the form of chains of characters. Because they follow some patterns,
it is possible to extract the key information which consists of a
variety of points. These points are then parsed to a handler that
compute them in order to obtain a center point and an orientation. The
position and the orientation of the device component are then updated.

Basing the position of our device on the computation of data sent with a
high debit does lead to some incoherences. This issue has been solved by
adding on the tracker a checker that allows only valid position.

\subsection{Graphical User Interface}\label{graphical-user-interface}

The GUI or simply called \emph{view} in the program, represents the
network loaded visually as seen on figure x. It serves as the reference
for which network and which interaction are being currently in use. A
new network can be loaded on live, this allows future applications of
the HaptiQ in which a user could change it himself.

It also includes a special window that acts as a visual representation
of the tactons currently in use for the device. This has been
extensively useful during the development phase in which sets of tactons
were visually tried before any further development. This could be seen
as the low fidelity prototype format of tactile interactions as it gives
a genreal hint of how the tacton will react; yet, the lack of sensation
makes it a very low fidelity.

\subsection{Interaction processor}\label{interaction-processor}

This thread checks which interaction is selected by the view and will
call the \emph{process} method for that interaction. For each time the
interaction is changed, this processor will make sure the previous one
gets closed properly and the new one \emph{open} - as described in the
interaction component.

\section{Design of the tactons}\label{design-of-the-tactons}

For our device, a tacton is the position of all the actuators for a
given time or for a short lapse of time. This time would be the
evolution of the levels until they repeat the pattern - like an
oscillation. The tacton is the language in which we are communicating
what is drawn under the pointing device. It could be a node, a link or
nothing at all - but each one of these situation leads to completely
different tactil signals and needs to be easily recognisable. One of the
goal of the internship is to evaluate the usability of each tactons.

In order to establish the most suited sets of tactons, I have proceeded
by iteration. For each actuator we have a range of height - which allow
the creation of interesting patterns like oscillations. Now, with eight
actuators, the possibilities skyrocks. Proceeding by iteration helps to
narrow the needed characteristics and avoid wasting development time. I
will explain in the following section the three main stages that have
guided me towards the current version which is still under testing.

In order to understand how tactons work, we have to explain for which
contexts they apply. Here are the following states that are considered
for our tactons:

(figure on node)

(figure on link)

(figure near)

(figure on nothing)

\subsection{First iteration of
tactons}\label{first-iteration-of-tactons}

My first iteration has proven me the good distinction between static and
oscillations and that an actuator should guide one graph element. I also
had to find a way of rapid prototyping a usual `paper design' is not
possible with tactile signals.

It has been evaluated by walkthrough on a visual feedback the 8th of
April 2015 \footnote{\url{https://github.com/asiegfried/vegham/tree/v0.1/app}}.
I have decided to represent visually the state of each actuator - the
darker, the higher. This has resulted in a relatively low fidelity
prototype of my set of tactons, yet it is sufficient to observe basic
usability problems. I have had to find my alternative of low fidelity
prototyping and this is how the visual representation came up.

Because of the early version of this interaction, links were not
integrated yet. The tactons to be generated depend on the following
rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  near a node, the tacton indicates the closest nodes by up and down
  oscillations. Actuators moved this way are the two closest angles, so
  if the node is at 40Â°, the North (90Â°) and the East (0Â°) actuators
  gets moved.
\item
  on a node, the tacton indicates the closest nodes by being fully up.
  The concerned actuators are the same as previously.
\end{itemize}

The intention in this set of tactons was to encode as much information
as possible. By using this perticular set of tactons, one would know
when he would be near a node because the oscillations would begin; at
the same time you would still know about nearby nodes. You could easily
distinguish when you are on a node

That was in theory, while experimenting roughly with my low fidelity
feedback, the subjects were feeling lost during the whole exploration
process inspite of me showing where were the ndoes. The following
interviews have revealed the reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  there was far too much information at a giving time
\item
  the interactions felt unatural
\item
  it was impossible to tell how many nodes were nearby
\end{itemize}

Although this interaction was highly depreciated, the task of know
whetether or not we were on a node or not was done accurately. A first
contribution from this first iteration is the efficient distinction
provided by static versus oscillation. This characteristic has been
preserved through the versions. A second one would be the fact that
having more than one actuator guiding a single node was too complex too
be easily processed by the user. This aspect has been taken into account
in the next iterations.

\subsection{Second iteration of
tactons}\label{second-iteration-of-tactons}

The second iteration has brought me consider simple tactons first and
high contrast could be one of the most important characteristic I was
looking for.

Another path was explored from my first iteration, I have tried to find
simpler tactons that could still provide guidance \footnote{\url{https://github.com/asiegfried/vegham/tree/v0.2/app}}.
The following rules conern this second iteration:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  near a node, the tacton indicates the direction towards it with a
  certain intensity. Only one actuator is moved for this tacton, it is
  the one closer to the angle. For instance for a node at 40Â° it will be
  just the East (0Â°) actuator. The intensity is inversly proportional to
  the distance. The closer, the higher the level would be.
\item
  on a node, all the actuators are higher than normal.
\end{itemize}

This interaction takes into account what has been remarked in the first
iteration. One actuator is for one node. Oscillation were reserved
purposely for the links, that have not been integrated to the software
at that time.

Another walkthrough has been tried on this interaction in order to
detect usability errors and just in general seeking other ideas. This
interaction has received several positive feedbacks. The sudden change
for when the pointer is on node makes the message very clear. The
growing intensity also indicated well the exploration. The major issue
remained the fact that these tests were based on visualisation as a
proxy of what the tactile sensations would be. Obviously these two
senses cannot be considered equivalent for my tactons; I had then
reached a limit for my low fidelity prototyping.

Yet, I have understood that simpler is generally better when it comes to
provide guidance. This aspect has motivated my further interaction. The
major contribution of this iteration has been the importance to keep a
clear contrast between the two situations: on node and not on a node.
Since the major difficulty is to find the network, it must be very clear
for the user when it is over a node or not. It accentuates a mental
marker on that very specific zone, it is also reasuring to have such a
clear and distinct tactile feedback.

\subsection{Final generation of
tactons}\label{final-generation-of-tactons}

A few other tactons have been developed while waiting the HatpiQ to be
build. After some hardware issues (that will be presented in
Implementation), I was able to provide the real sensation of the HaptiQ
and this was highly valuable in order to seek the features that would
lead to a suitable tactons.

After several tries through the hardware capacities and my self
judgment, I came up with a last generation of four sets of tactons. The
goal was to compare them in a user study and being able to justify the
most appropriate one for graph exploration. During the first tries out
of this user study, I had to withdraw two of them as they appeared to be
completely unusable for the required task. Two of my collaborators, one
visually impaired one not have experienced the same struggles in using
some of these tacton sets. Among other issues, the users felt
overwhelmed with the tactile information - like arriving on a node, all
the actuators were moving at the same time. And also, it appeared that
the intensity that felt like an interesting idea in the second
iteration, turned out to be completely unperceptable in the real
situation. We can sum up that the main reason why they were not
efficient is because of their lack of simplicity and consistency. I had
to remove them in order to focus on the most promising ones.

The two remaining tacton sets are the result of an iterative exploratory
and are to be compared in a usability study. One can be considered as a
direct mapping of the underneath situation when the second provides an
additional guidance.

\subsubsection{Mapping}\label{mapping}

This tacton sets simply encodes into tactile feedbacks what is directly
underneath the device. It has been narrowed to three very strict rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  on a node, the actuators which direction corresponds to the direction
  of a connected node are up, the rest are down.
\item
  on a link, the actuators which direction are parallel to the direction
  of the link are oscillating up and down on an high level, the rest are
  left down.
\item
  on nothing, all the actuators are down.
\end{itemize}

When moving the device onto a node, some actuators goes from a down
level to a up level: their is a high contrast between these two tactile
situations which respects the criteria of a high contrast found during
the second iteration. We have also made good usage of the duality of
static versus oscillation as they both encode distinct facets of the
exploration. Static is for the nodes and emphasize on pausing and maybe
remembering this perticular point. Whereas, oscillations are for
travelling between nodes and this constant feedback of the direction to
go can be seen as an encouragment to proceed.

\subsubsection{Guidance}\label{guidance}

Very close to the previous set of tactons, Guidance offers just one more
rule in order to help keeping track of the network.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  on a node, the actuators which direction corresponds to the direction
  of a connected node are up, the rest are down.
\item
  on a link, the actuators which direction are parallel to the direction
  of the link are oscillating up and down, the rest are left down.
\item
  near a link, the one actuator which direction is the closest to which
  the link is, oscillates in a low level.
\item
  on nothing and near nothing, all the actuators are down.
\end{itemize}

Just as the Mapping set, this one respects the criteria established
during the two previous iterations: high contrast and static versus
oscillation for two different exploration phases. It includes a quick
guidance that helps user to return quickly on their track. Even though a
new tacton is used, the help provided can be worth it. The questions
rised by this alternative are untangled in the Evaluation chapter.

\subsection{Remarks}\label{remarks}

I have not talked about a basic criteria which is to prevent a single
tacton signal representing two distinct situations. It is the first
level towards consistency, obviously. As one would notice, the sets have
been constantly moving towards simplicity and contrast. One can argue
that providing guidance is obviously more usable, but since the
beginning of my internship I have been surprised by the difficulty of
finding the key elements for a good tactile sensation. I have not taken
this for granted and this is why I felt the user study is justified.
Besides, providing some analyse feedbacks on the differences of mapping
versus guidance can surely be seen as a minor contribution in the
understanding of tactile feedback based on vector for graph exploration.
We may appreciate the fact that, as an engineer it is easy to see many
different ways to encode in tactons the underneath situation of a
pointing device. As challenging as it seems, this approach does not
consider the usability aspect.

This chapter has described the design of the software, the tactons and
the hardware. Furthermore, it has detailed the reason of the iteration
over some of them. We end up having a relatively inexpensive device -
around \euro{300} and reproductible. The software is opensource and
using the HaptiQ interactions is cross-platform; it is even designed to
welcome new interaction techniques for the device or to ease comparison.
The implementation of this design has lead to some rationale desicions
as well which will be detail in the Implementation chapter.
