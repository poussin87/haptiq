Our design should therefore meet the requirements previously stated. Even though, a tactile vector based device is an innovation towards haptics input output device, it should be made inexpensive enough in order to make it affordable for the visually impaired people. It is also a development path in which we can hope better chances for further contributions.

The HaptiQ is an enhanced mouse in which tactile feedbacks that helps to explore graph. The feedbacks are giving by actuators on the top of the device and are in contact with the hands.
