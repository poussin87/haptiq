Evaluation
==========

The purpose of this internship is to be able to understand what makes a good tacton sets and how does it compete with other interatcions already used for exploration. To answer those two questions we have conducted two user studies.

Beyond simply gathering data on the usage of tacton sets, we are incapable of chosing a set over another; therefore, our first user study is a justfication of a choice used in the second one. We can claim that since that specific tactons set is preferred, it is the most suited competitor against other interaction techniques.

User study A: about the HaptiQ
------------------------------

Two sets of tactile signals have been developed: one is purely mapping what is under the device (M) when the second adds some guidance (G). These two sets - M and G, are the result of an iterative process where we were able to improve the tactons as described in the Design section. As described in the Design section, four sets were initially prepared for this user study, but two of them has proven very little usability in the first tries.

Hypothesis
^^^^^^^^^^

We are looking for an answer on the best set of tactile signals, in order to prove or disprove the usability of one we will start with the following statement. With the end results, we would then be able to confirm or deny our hypothesis.


1. The set G is more **efficient** than M.
2. The set G is more **effective** than M.
3. The set G is more **satisfying** than M.


Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

The subjects were informed about the HaptiQ project and the purpose of this evaluation. They were given a disclaimer to read and sign before starting the experiment. A form was then given to fill out - this form was to check if there is any training for the subject on haptic devices. Before the eye mask was placed, they were told that they could leave the experiment at any given time without having to justify.

They were then instructed to manipulate the device in order to feel it without tactile signal. This is a way to make sure the users were comfortable holding the device and the time frame was also used to answer questions regarding its holding or its robustness. Besides, as mentioned in our task analysis, a first step for exploring a graph using a haptic device is to get familiar with the tactile sensation. Ultimately, this free ride helped the subjetcs getting a mental representation of the frame that represented their workspace. I emphasized on the importance that it was an evaluation about the interactions and not their personal performance. Another crucial point was to give a purpose for their performance which was speed - this has been shared the same way among all the subjects. When done, a training network was loaded with one of the two sets. I then described all the tactons involved in this set and the way they are triggered before letting the exploration begin on the training network. I purposely asked them what they felt and if they were understanding the meanings of the tactons. I was also assisting their exploration in order to avoid frustration. When ready, I loaded a second graph that was used as a blank test; we could then agree on a way to share the answer eg. "a central node with one connection to the North and one to the South-East". I then told them that there would be six similar tasks to perform as fast as possible and that I would give them a "Go" which meant that they could start anytime from the signal as I have started the recordings manually on their first move. I believe that this procedure helped to relieve some stress for the start periods.

The graphs used were always a central node in the center of the frame with one, two or three connections around it. This information has been shared among all the subjects before begining the evaluation. The application allows generating such type of graphs randomly depending on which number of connections wanted. For the six tests, a random order of the following possibilities was selected differently for each subject:

- one graph with one connection
- three graphs with two connections
- two graphs with three connections

Other graphs were planned and we were to retry the same experiment as explained in [ref needed], but the first tries have revealed strong difficulties in their exploration. Although possible, we have preferred to go with smaller and simpler network giving us more time for more tasks to be performed.

When an interaction had been evaluated, a SUS questionnaire about satisfaction was then given to the experimentator. Remarks on that specifc set of tactons were taken into account after it being filled. When done, the process was tried again with the remaining interaction. At the end, the subjects were asked for a preference and remarks on the device were then co


Measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each task, the following data were computed:

- quality of answer (Wrong or False)
- time spent from moving the device to hands off the device - before the answer was given
- ratio of the time spent on the netwrok out of total time of exploration
- distance travelled

We could therefore regroup these measurements into the three main characteristics of usability:

1. Effectiveness: quality of the answers
2. Efficiency: time, ratio and distance
3. Satisfaction: SUS questionnaire and the remarks

Subjects
^^^^^^^^

All the subjects were between 24 and 27 years old, half male, half female. Two of them were left handed, yet they both used the mouse on the right hand (they were not asked to do so, they just did). None of the subjects had a regular usage of haptic devices, although some declared having little to moderate experience with haptics in general.

Results
^^^^^^^

All the subjects has preferred the guidance tactons and this is backed with the SUS scores which have all been higher for G than for M. The T test of Student for paired values gives a highly significative p-value (0.004693) which suggest a real difference.

Six errors have been made with M and five with G; given that small differences we are in no position to confirm nor deny our hypothesis on a more effective set of tactons.

On a qualitative level, several remarks have been made by the participants. They have shared a feeling of being lost or having a broken device when exploring too long outisde of the network with M. The noise has played a part in their ability to understand the situation. Although we might see this as an interferance with the usage of the HaptiQ, we can accept a reasonable amount of noise when using the device as it may help to get whether or not there is a sudden change of tactons.


We have several indicators going towards a clear preference for the G which conforts our intuition. Still, the lack of effectiveness raises questions.
