Abstract
========

Graph - as a vector of information, is widely used; it is cross-cultural and does not require specific knowledge to easily learn from. Even though it is easily digitizable, accessibility for graphs is not the trend in today's research and technology progress. Meanwhile, the technology gap with visually impaired people is increasing and they are more and more likely to require assitance to benefit from this progress. There are 285 million visually impaired people worldwide: 39 million of them are blind, and 246 million have remaining visual capacities. Standard printed drawings and diagrams are not accessible to visually impaired people, which may have a general impact on spatial cognition and space representation. The HaptiQ is a haptic device providing mutliple tactile feedbacks in forms of segments. Such guidance would allow a more natural approach in graph exploration and therefore would contribute to blind accessibility with an easily repoducable and affordable device.

Introduction
============

Graphs can be found in the undergrounds to help travellers find their way, in maps where paths connects various point of interests, in school books to help pupils understand abstract notions. They are a synthesized way to represent information and its usage is widely spread across countries and fields of study. We are so used to them, that our day-to-day life is filled by them without us noticing. This vector of information is not limited by the language, does not require perticular knowledge; it can be used for various context, for various data and can be easily digitilize and thus, transportable or modifyable. Yet its representation is graphical and therefore relies on sight. Finding alternatives in order to access these graphical information is a major issue for the visually impaired population to overcome. 

The digital gap is there, and while technology assist everyone's tasks better and faster, people with disabilities are more and more dependent on other's help to benefit from this progress.
Braille - which is considered to be the most used form of tactile graphics, is being depreciated for tablets. Although the latter allows enriched interactions and a comforting object to hold on to; they do not combine with the former. The need for a new vector of information is real.
More and more data is being produced, this comes with dedicated jobs like Data Analysts and dedicated research like Information visualisation. The increase of research activity in this field has been substential over the last 20 years. We are in the age of Big Data with challenges for a better understanding, visualisation, sharing; yet, accessibility tends to be neglicted.

In the laboratory of the SACHI team in St Andrews - Scotland, a small haptic device has been developed: the Haptic Tabletop Puck (HTP). By moving this special mouse, the user receives haptic feedbacks which can be used for exploration. Although this device allows multiple interactions, the main issue is that there is a single actuator for mapping the height of what is under. The way to explore would be to *bump* onto the limits.
If we were to build another device that would allow multiple feedbacks, we would have a more efficient exploration; users would feel where to go. If we were to have longer segment instead of single point under the palms, the users could follow directions. Such a device could be a first window in the accessibility of graphs exploration for visually impaired people as the interaction techniques would be purely tactile. Furtheremore, the audio channel is heavily used for accessibility and developing other interaction contributes in the global autonomy of visually impaired people.

The HaptiQ project aims to design and evaluate an inexpensive haptic device that allows blind users to acquire the representation of graphs and therefore, the key to the understanding of spatial information - like maps, or abstract concepts - like organigrams. The project is framed by Dr Nacenta (St Andrews, UK) and Dr Jouffrais (Toulouse, FR).

I will present in this report the main steps that has led to the creation of this device. I will explain the starting context of the project and the analysing phase; then the design decisions made for this project followed by the way I have implemented them. Finally, I will explain the methods used for the evaluation and an ending discussion about the results and a personal feedback on the skills in human-computer interactions that has been employed for this project.

Context
=======

About accessibility
-------------------

Given the 10th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, there is 4 categories:

	- normal vision
	- moderate visual impairment
	- severe visual impairment
	- blindness

Visual impairment includes the last two and it concerns 285 millions of people worldwide

Blind is defined to be

Conclusion
==========

UX designer has increased in the UK, the US... it's becoming interesting for european countries. Yet, France industrials do not consider as seriously as these other countries. How we, ENAC student of the Master IHM can stand for more usability in the software development in France? Besides software development has starting to be outsourced for cheaper wages. Lived in romania... IT students should be concerned about this, as they will not be able to compete very long. I see two possibilities to maintain (interest), being an expert in a particular technology or starting to 
This is the kind of things I think would be beneficial for students to hear from our teachers. 

Justifying is key to ux, and reporting is key for justification. My placement has lacked of reporting as it was difficult to understand what needed to be retracable and what not. Started with a board journal, but it's actually killing the information. Better is to focus on main steps like brainstorming, informal evaluation, 

This report may take some strong position that better experts than me could easily critcise, and I would be happy to see them. I have just started to grasp to idea of a good UX design and this report can be seen as an effort to summarize my understanding.

This report has also been emphasizing the development side of the internship on purpose. UX designers are the interpret between users and developers. They should have a global understanding of computing as well as human behaviors. From my point of view, a good UX designer should be able to easily switch between platforms and limit his preferences, he should have also invested enough time to understand the tricks and ways of upcoming development process and that requires to deal with less user friendly tools. Yet, it's necessary to take this path. I am convinced that quality code and efforts made towards best practices lead to better design in the end by time saving, easy iteration and codeveloper friendly.



The work becomes research once the last sentence of the report written. Like, problem we allow people using results, but how about the device itself? Research can also consider the fact of making your project redoable.

.. Justify
.. =======
.. (key ideas: HCI can be easily countered, tests are ok but eaisly falsiable, but how about we - UX designer create a clear way of justification our work, requires a lot of honesty, but it could be very beneficial and we can have an immediate feeling of how suitable for users the product is, this why I would like to suggest this recap)

.. - why not using dream -> unhappy with software and think it misses the point, yet, it's a good effort towards design justification
.. why not purely citing papers -> my opinion is that papers should be referenced for critical stuff, also citing a paper can be misleading. The academics field knows that there is a variety of quality in papers and scholars know how to evaluate it, but how about others? If your work is to be kept in this field, no problem, but if we were to think UX design with an open-source perspective, we will be able to benefit from it only if we make the justifications readable. Citing a paper does not make it readable, it just adds a step of complexity for an idea that could be summarize in one sentence.

.. Evaluate
.. ========
.. (key idea is that this evaluation phase is for users only)
.. user study (iterative, approuved, self testing, real testing, logging)
.. informal testing (iterative, various persons, enrich the development, quick enough to be done on the spot -> force you to always have something to show)
.. personal critic (okay that one is far fetched, but there is a reason to continue to have a critic eye on one's work, you need )
.. statistics

.. + more users? more VI?
