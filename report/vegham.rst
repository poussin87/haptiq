Introduction
============

Graphs can be found in the undergrounds to help travellers find their way, in maps where paths connects various point of interests, in school books to help pupils understand abstract notions. They are a synthesized way to represent information and its usage is widely spread across countries and fields of study. We are so used to them, that we do not notice its presence. This vector of information is not limited by the language, does not require perticular knowledge; it can be used for various context, for various data and can be easily digitilize and thus, transportable or modifyable. Yet its representation is graphical and therefore relies on sight. Finding alternatives in order to access these graphical information is a major issue to overcome for the visually impaired population. 

The digital gap is there, and while technology assist everyone's tasks better and faster, people with disabilities are more and more dependent on other's help to benefit from this progress.
Braille - which is considered to be the most used form of tactile graphics, is being depreciated for tablets. Although the latter allows enriched interactions and a comforting object to hold on to; they do not combine with the former. The need for a new vector of information is real.
More and more data is being produced, this comes with dedicated jobs like Data Analysts and dedicated research like Information visualisation. The increase in activity of the field has been substential over the last 20 years. We are in the age of Big Data with challenges for a better understanding, visualisation, sharing; yet, accessibility tends to be neglicted.

Supervised by the neuro scientist doctor Christophe Jouffrais and the doctor in HCI Miguel Nacenta, my internship is intented to give a first view of how we can assist a better understanding of graphs without using sight. Audio would come as the first alternative, but since it is massively used in everyday's tasks, we wanted to avoid polluting this media. Tactile sensations allows multiple information at the same day, and makes it a preferable candidate than audio.


[Solutions are there to get immediate information, but we are looking for a way to enable an intuitive exploration of graphs.]

The VEGHAM project aims to design and evaluate an inexpensive haptic device that allows blind users to acquire mathematical and spatial knowledge. The project is based on former work of Dr Nacenta’s group (St Andrews, UK) on haptic devices prototyping, and Dr Jouffrais’ group (Toulouse, FR) on non-visual perception and cognition of blind users.

Conclusion
==========

UX designer has increased in the UK, the US... it's becoming interesting for european countries. Yet, France industrials do not consider as seriously as these other countries. How we, ENAC student of the Master IHM can stand for more usability in the software development in France? Besides software development has starting to be outsourced for cheaper wages. Lived in romania... IT students should be concerned about this, as they will not be able to compete very long. I see two possibilities to maintain (interest), being an expert in a particular technology or starting to 
This is the kind of things I think would be beneficial for students to hear from our teachers. 

Justifying is key to ux, and reporting is key for justification. My placement has lacked of reporting as it was difficult to understand what needed to be retracable and what not. Started with a board journal, but it's actually killing the information. Better is to focus on main steps like brainstorming, informal evaluation, 

This report may take some strong position that better experts than me could easily critcise, and I would be happy to see them. I have just started to grasp to idea of a good UX design and this report can be seen as an effort to summarize my understanding.

This report has also been emphasizing the development side of the internship on purpose. UX designers are the interpret between users and developers. They should have a global understanding of computing as well as human behaviors. From my point of view, a good UX designer should be able to easily switch between platforms and limit his preferences, he should have also invested enough time to understand the tricks and ways of upcoming development process and that requires to deal with less user friendly tools. Yet, it's necessary to take this path. I am convinced that quality code and efforts made towards best practices lead to better design in the end by time saving, easy iteration and codeveloper friendly.



The work becomes research once the last sentence of the report written. Like, problem we allow people using results, but how about the device itself? Research can also consider the fact of making your project redoable.

=====
code engineering (evolutive structure, identifying what is key)
testing and coverage (how to make sure the whole is still functional if we add change one thing?)
python (developer friendly)
versioning (tag previous versions, can come back easily, facilitate open source)
documenting (why? -> , how?, small remark about comments)
refactoring (helps understanding the code and the logic better)

polyvalent (3D printing, TUIO, )
communication skills (two labs, two different views of the final build, different ways: latex, )
proactive intelligence (explaining why, how: twitter, feedly, reddit)

Justify
=======
(key ideas: HCI can be easily countered, tests are ok but eaisly falsiable, but how about we - UX designer create a clear way of justification our work, requires a lot of honesty, but it could be very beneficial and we can have an immediate feeling of how suitable for users the product is, this why I would like to suggest this recap)

- why not using dream -> unhappy with software and think it misses the point, yet, it's a good effort towards design justification
why not purely citing papers -> my opinion is that papers should be referenced for critical stuff, also citing a paper can be misleading. The academics field knows that there is a variety of quality in papers and scholars know how to evaluate it, but how about others? If your work is to be kept in this field, no problem, but if we were to think UX design with an open-source perspective, we will be able to benefit from it only if we make the justifications readable. Citing a paper does not make it readable, it just adds a step of complexity for an idea that could be summarize in one sentence.

Evaluate
========
(key idea is that this evaluation phase is for users only)
user study (iterative, approuved, self testing, real testing, logging)
informal testing (iterative, various persons, enrich the development, quick enough to be done on the spot -> force you to always have something to show)
personal critic (okay that one is far fetched, but there is a reason to continue to have a critic eye on one's work, you need )
statistics

+ more users? more VI?
