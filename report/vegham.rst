Or a guide on how to find and solve usability problems through a concrete example


Introduction
============


Context
=======
visually impaired people over the world
presenting the two teams -> SACHI progress on the HaptiQ
the challenges -> search collaboration, 

Analysing
=========
(key concepts: having a clear understanding of what is going on with visually impaired people)

State of the art
understanding the usage (constant talking with VI supervisor Bernard, exploring documentation made about VI)
scenarios
tasks modeling

+ observations, personas



Adaptability
============
code engineering (evolutive structure, identifying what is key)
testing and coverage (how to make sure the whole is still functional if we add change one thing?)
python (developer friendly)
versioning (tag previous versions, can come back easily, facilitate open source)
refactoring (helps understanding the code and the logic better)
iterative


Justifying
==========
 (key ideas: HCI can be easily countered, tests are ok but eaisly falsiable, but how about we - UX designer create a clear way of justification of our work, requires a lot of honesty, but it could be very beneficial and we can have an immediate feeling of how suitable for users the product is, this why I would like to suggest this recap)

why not using dreams -> unhappy with software and think it misses the point, yet, it's a good effort towards design justification
why not purely citing papers -> my opinion is that papers should be referenced for critical stuff like 



Evaluating
==========
user study (iterative, approuved, self testing, real testing, logging)
informal testing (iterative, various persons, enrich the development, quick enough to be done on the spot -> force you to always have something to show)
personal critic (okay that one is far fetched, but there is a reason to continue to have a critic eye on one's work, you need )
  




Further work
