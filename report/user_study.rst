Context
=======

This section will present the context of the usability study for the HaptiQ with vectorial guidance.


Hypothesis
----------

The development of the HaptiQ has been motivated by the possibility of providing a new guidance for visually impaired people. Graphs can be used for grasping geometrical dimension such as maps as well as abstract ideas such as organigram. We have focus our efforts in order to provide a device that is adapated for the exploration of graphs. Our goal was to make the HaptiQ device more usable than other audio guidance for learning as well as navigating from graphs.


Subjects
--------

12 subjects participated in the experiment, 6 were legally blind when the 6 others were blindfolded. This experiment was conducted with the informed consent of all the participants and with their written authorization. 
TODO: 1 - 2 sentences about subjects -> used to navigate with device, audio etc...


Factors
-------

A usability study evaluates the three following key factors:

1. Efficiency: The HaptiQ vectorial guidance should allow its user to explore graphs and to acquire knowledge from them.
2. Effictiveness: The HaptiQ vectorial guidance should require less time for its users to explore and learn from graphs compare to audio guidance usage.
3. Satisfaction: The HaptiQ vectorial guidance should provide to its users a better degree of satisfaction compare to audio guidance usage.



Procedure
=========

This section will present the evaluation protocol, which consits in a training phase, a Navigation task and a learning task.

Training phase
--------------

This experiment includes a training phase in order to help the participants to get used to both of the guidance interaction. It will illustrate all the different feedbacks possible with both of the techniques. This has been achieved by setting manually the location pointed by the device on a specific area that would map the different feedbacks.
TODO: illustrate with graphs
The situations are the following: far from node, near node, on node, on node with one link, near link (up), near link (down), on link, on link near node, on node and multiple links.

Each interaction technique has been tried on these situations and the users was asked to recognise them. Once the user recognised them all, he was welcome to explore a map freely and to ask for conformation on which situation he is actually facing. He was warned that this exploration cannot last longer than 10 minutes.

The next steps of the procedures consisted in two main tasks, a navigation one and a learning one. It has been separated this way as a way to represent two different purposes achievable with graphs.
Both of these tasks would be using the two different guidance techniques. In order to counter balance biais linked to the order four population groups was formed: AHAH, AHHA, HAHA, HAAH (A for audio and H for HaptiQ).
Related to graphs, we have created 2 specific one for the navigation and 2 for the learning. They have been alternate between the groups to avoid bias related to the graph order. They have also been built in order to make comparable to its analog one. Finally, there has been a last graph made for the training and this was made unique, again to avoid learning bias.

Navigation task
---------------

The participant has been set on a top left corner of a graph.

The first subtask was to explore each of the nodes as fast as possible and to say whenever he was done. He was then asked how many nodes there was on this graph. He was then placed on a specific node and was asked to find the shortest way in terms of node between his position and node x.
After the task completed or after 10 mintues - considered as a fail, the candidate was asked to go to node X and from there to follow one of the link. His task was to estimate the middle position between the two nodes on this link. He was then asked on an absolute location, where we would be. 

After completing this taks with the two techniques, the participant was then asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire in order to evaluate his preferences and in order to collect general remark.

Learning task
-------------

The participant has been set on the top node of the graph. The graph represented an organigram where each node would be a name. Before the task began, candidate were informed that we would be asked to draw from memory the graph.

This task consisted in answering as quickly as possible the following questions:
Who has the least connection?
Who has the most?
How many node/person would there be between two given people on the shortest path?
Which person should be removed if we want this person to be unreachable from that person?
Which connection should we remove if we want this person to be unreachable from that person?
They were then asked to draw the organigram from memory. 

After completing this taks with the two techniques, the participant was then asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire in order to evaluate his preferences and in order to collect general remark.
